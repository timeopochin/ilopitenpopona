          <h3>
            introduction
          </h3>
          <p>
          i created this tool to take away the mental load of deciding what subject to revise and when to do so.
          i ensured that it was simple enough yet <em>smart</em> enough to be worth the time spent using it.
          after all, there is no point in using a tool if you save less time than you actually spend using it.
          </p>
          <p>
          the main concept that this tool is based on is that of <strong>sessions</strong>.
          a session is a revision period dedicated to a single subject.
          sessions have a set time <em>(i recommend no more than 1 hour)</em>.
          this tool aims to give you a list of subjects you must revise <em>today</em>,
          and to make you revise no more that 1 session per subject per day.
          </p>
          <p>
          each day, this tool gives you a, simple to understand, checklist based on each subjects’ priorities. these priorities are calculated by taking into consideration 3 things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>days left</strong>: well… the days left to finish all the sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>sessions left</strong>: again… quit self explanatory.</li>
            <li><strong>urgency</strong>: ah yes, slightly less obvious, urgency will boost priority of subjects that need to be completed <em>soon</em>. any subject that needs completing in less than a week will be boosted. the sooner the deadline the greater the boost.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            the hard bit
          </h3>
          <p>
          deciding the priority of tasks in any system, is hard.
          my aim was to avoid the need to choose priorities for my subjects, so every subject is <em>created equal</em>.
          but there is still a decision to be made for each subject that will affect the priority, and this is the hard bit.
          you need to decide how many sessions you need to complete to finish the subject.
          this is still going to depend on each individual: you might need to spend twice as much time on algebra than on history;
          but i think this way of thinking is much easier than trying to give subjects a "priority", as it has a realworld measure.
          </p>
          <p>
          and obviously, once a subject is created, nothing prevents you from changing this number later.
          </p>
          <h3>
            today’s checklist
          </h3>
          <p>
          <strong>today’s checklist</strong> is the page where you can see the result of this tool’s high level artifitial intelligence algorithm that perfectly organised and planned out every detail of EVERYTHING <em>(okay i may be exaggerating, but it is where the magic happens)</em>.
          you can see today’s sessions ordered by priority, but also organised in 5 categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>overdue</strong>: these are subjects that you will not be able to complete all the sessions for in time by doing only 1 session a day.</li>
            <li><strong>must do</strong>: these are the subjects that you must complete sessions for every day to finish them <em>(this is mostly true, but urgency can also bring a subject up into this category, see introduction)</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>should do</strong>: these are the subjects that you should complete sessions for to avoid falling behind.</li>
            <li><strong>recommended</strong>: its always better to get ahead, if you can.</li>
            <li><strong>bonus</strong>: subjects that are so distant that you should only really consider working on them if the other categories are empty.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            manage subjects
          </h3>
          <p>
          the <strong>manage</strong> page is where you will add, remove and update your subjects.
          all of your subject will be displayed on this page <em>(ordered alphabetically)</em>.
          you will be able to see these properties of each subject:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>sessions left</strong>, this is the number of sessions you still have to do.</li>
            <li><strong>name</strong>, please don’t make me explain this one.</li>
            <li><strong>due before</strong>, this is the date <em>before</em> which you must finish all your sessions <em>(a good example of why i chose this over a "due by" date, is exams. you shouldn’t, and often cannot revise on the day of the exam)</em>.</li>
          </ul>
